    "Our programs in the first few chapters of the book make heavy use of Python lists. As a matter of fact, we typically go one step farther and opt for list comprehensions, whenever that is possible. After some introductory discussion, all of these Python lists are \"homogeneous\", in the sense that they contain elements of only one type. Furthermore, since we use list comprehensions so often, it's easy to see that the list size is always known ahead of time, i.e., there is no need to keep appending, until some condition is met (or, to be fair, we structure our codes so that this is so). In this context, here’s an example of a common operation one could carry out:\n",
    "\n",
    "tots = [w*f(x) for w,x in zip(ws,xs)]\n",
    "\n",
    "namely, stepping through one list (or more) and applying a function or multiplying by a coefficient, which may be different for each item. Here, we are essentially carrying out the same operation over and over again, a fixed number of times. At the end of that process, we typically sum up all the elements in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "This raises the natural question: wouldn’t it make more sense to carry out such tasks using a homogeneous, fixed-length container? This is precisely what the Numerical Python array object does: as a result, it is fast and space-efficient. In addition to this, it allows us to avoid, for the most part, having to write loops: even in our listcomps, which are more concise than standard loops, there is a need to explicitly step through each element one by one. Numerical Python arrays often obviate such syntax, allowing us to carry out mathematical operations on entire blocks of data in one step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear algebra applications, in particular, which entail heavy use of fixed-length, homogeneous entities (namely, mathematical matrices) can benefit from numpy arrays, which is why we make a slight detour here, to introduce them. In standard Python, matrices can be represented by lists of lists which are, however, quite clunky, in that their syntax is different from the mathematical notation you are already used to. Before we tackle the two-dimensional case, which will be of interest in chapter 4, we first go over one-dimensional numpy arrays, which are direct replacements for Python lists, like the tots mentioned above. From here onward, we will not keep referring to these new containers as numpy arrays: they’ll simply be called arrays, the same way the core-Python lists are simply called lists."

As you may recall from there, slices of lists gave de facto copies, so the original list was unaffected by subsequent changes to the slice. This behavior of slices led us to use L[:] to get a copy of the list L.

Other numpy functions may be new to you, but can turn out to be very useful, e.g. numpy.isfinite() or numpy.sort().

Numpy also has functions that take in an array and return a scalar, like the numpy.sum() we encountered above. These are reasonably named, e.g. numpy.prod() calculates the product of all element values and numpy.amin() returns the element with the smallest value. Another very helpful function is numpy.argmax(), which returns the index of the maximum value.

    "Recall that we are using Python's 0-indexing, so the rows are numbered 0th, 1st, 2nd, and analogously for the columns. (In regular English, the example above is referring to the third row and second column – we’ll use numbers, e.g. 2nd, when employing the 0-indexing convention). This double pair of brackets, separating the numbers from each other is quite cumbersome and also different from how matrix notation is usually done, e.g., $A_{ij}$ or $A_{i, j}$. Thus, it comes as a relief to see that numpy array elements can be indexed simply by using only one pair of square brackets and a comma-separated pair of numbers, for example:"

Given that these features are identical to what we encountered in the previous section, we assume they’re clear to the reader. That being said, there do exist several handy functions that are intuitively easier to grasp for the case of two-dimensional arrays, e.g., numpy.diag() to get the diagonal elements, or numpy.tril() to get the lower triangle of an array and numpy.triu() to get the upper triangle. Finally, another very helpful function is numpy.eye() which looks equivalent to numpy.identity() but, conveniently, also allows us to populate elements on the diagonals above or below the main diagonal; for example, try out numpy.eye(5, k=-2). You should study the documentation to discover further functionality.\n",

This is the same format used by the C programming language. (If you wish to use, instead, Fortran’s column-major format, presumably in order to interoperate with code in that language, you simply pass in an appropriate keyword argument when creating the numpy array).
