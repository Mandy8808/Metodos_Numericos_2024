Note that the first two lines show us we could (if we wanted to) use Python as a calculator. The next line provided us with our first example of using a variable: in this case we created a variable x and assigned the value 42 to it. (Numbers like 3 or 42 are known as literals). We then used the print() function to print out the variable’s value to the screen. This is our first use of a function: as in mathematics, we use parentheses to show that we are passing in an argument. We won’t go into the different versions of Python at this point, assuming for now that you are using Python 3, where the above example is legitimate. (We discuss \n",

For example, therm is better than thermodynamic\\_property. On the other hand, also keep in mind that “meaningful is good”: for example, therm is typically a better name than t. That being said, if you are dealing with the time parameter, it’s probably wiser to name it t rather than time.\n",

    "Before concluding this subsection, let us make some general comments about the\n",
    "conventions we will employ in the book which this tutorial is accompanying. We mentioned earlier that a function will be interacting with the external world only via its parameters (input) and its return value (output). Thus, we won’t be, e.g., modifying a list that was passed in to our function as an argument. A related question is whether or not we should access variables from inside a function that were defined outside it (and were not passed in as arguments). This is sometimes tempting: especially if you know you are not going to change that variable’s value inside the function, what’s the harm in simply accessing it? The motivation for this is a wish to keep the number of parameters small: instead of explicitly naming as parameters all the variables you’re going to need inside the function, you simply access them when the need arises. Unfortunately, this approach can lead to headaches down the line: it’s much easier to reason about what a function does when you can clearly see what input it takes in, what it does to the input, and what it communicates to the external world (through the return statement).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the approach we’ll employ in what follows, with the partial exception that we allow the calling of other functions from within our function, without feeling the need to pass these functions in as arguments. This will depend on the specific situation we’re faced with each time. For example, our function der(), which takes in as an argument the function to be differentiated, is more flexible (and therefore better) than cosder(), which is hard-wired to handle cosines exclusively. On the other hand, when we defined our function mag() we didn’t think twice about having it call the function sqrt(), without passing the latter in as an argument (which would help you if, e.g., you wanted to pass in your very own cruder-but-faster implementation of the square root). As a rule of thumb, you should pass a function in as an argument if you foresee that you might be passing in another function in its place in the future (as in the case of der()). If you basically expect to always keep carrying out the same task (as in the case of mag()), there’s no need to add yet another parameter to your function definition."

You can imagine that as our transformations get more involved it becomes wiser to define a new function like we did here (for a trivial case). What’s even more exciting is that the fin=f in the definition of transf() allows us to call transf() with only one argument (a number). This is incredibly useful if you want to use your transformed function as part of another piece of code, that expects your interface to be “I give you a number and you return a number”.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, it’s worth bringing your attention to another idiom which you may encounter in the wild: there was no need to use a new name (i.e., fin) for the parameter of transf() that is a function. In other words, that could have been called simply... f, leading to a definition that looks like this:"

Inside the loop, we use split() to split the line into a list containing the numbers in string format.

You then need to produce a string representing the line, which will consist of x converted to a string, then a space, then y converted to a string, and then a newline character.
